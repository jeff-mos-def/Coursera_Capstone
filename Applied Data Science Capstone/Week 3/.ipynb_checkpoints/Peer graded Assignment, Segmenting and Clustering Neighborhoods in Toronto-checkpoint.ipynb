    "Now that you have built a dataframe of the postal code of each neighborhood along with the borough name and neighborhood name, in order to utilize the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.\n",

    "In an older version of this course, we were leveraging the Google Maps Geocoding API to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. However, recently Google started charging for their API: [http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/](http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/), so we will use the Geocoder Python package instead: [https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html](https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html).\n",

So you can make a call to get the latitude and longitude coordinates of a given postal code and the result would be None, and then make the call again and you would get the coordinates. So, in order to make sure that you get the coordinates for all of our neighborhoods, you can run a while loop for each postal code. Taking postal code M5G as an example, your code would look something like this:\n",
